Project Assignment: Offline YouTube Video Summarizer
Role: Full-Time AI Engineer
This document outlines the take-home assignment for the full-time AI Engineer position. The goal of this project is to assess your ability to design and build a complete, end-to-end AI system using offline models. This task will evaluate your skills in system architecture, model selection and implementation, and practical software engineering.

Objective
Build a system that accepts a YouTube video URL and generates a concise summary of its content. A critical constraint is that all AI models (speech-to-text and summarization) must run entirely offline, without relying on any cloud-based APIs for the core processing.

Project Description
You are to create an application that performs the following steps:
1.	Takes a public YouTube video URL as input.
2.	Download the audio from the video.
3.	Transcribes the audio into text using an offline speech-to-text model.
4.	Summarizes the transcribed text using an offline text summarization model.
5.	Outputs the final summary to the user.

The final application can be a Command-Line Interface (CLI) or a simple web application (e.g., using Flask or FastAPI).

Core Components and Technical Requirements
1. YouTube Audio Downloader
You will need a module to extract and download the audio track from a given YouTube URL.
Recommended Libraries: You can use libraries such as pytube or yt-dlp.
2. Offline Speech-to-Text (STT)
The core of the transcription process must be an offline model that you set up and run locally.
Model Requirements: You must use an open-source model capable of running without an internet connection.
3. Offline Text Summarization
Once you have the transcript, you need to summarize it using another offline model. You can choose between extractive or abstractive summarization techniques.
Model Requirements: The model must be pre-downloaded and run locally.
Task: Select a summarization model, explain your choice, and use it to condense the transcript.
Expected Deliverables
Please submit a link to a private Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) containing the following:
1.	Source Code: All the code for your project. The repository should be well-organized.
2.	README.md File: This is a crucial part of your submission. It should include:
a.	Project Overview: A brief description of your project.
b.	Setup and Installation Instructions: Detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to set up the environment (e.g., requirements.txt for Python), download the necessary models, and run the application.
c.	Design Choices and Justification: Explain your architectural decisions. Why did you choose specific models for transcription and summarization? Discuss any trade-offs you considered (e.g., model size vs. accuracy).
d.	Usage: Clear instructions on how to use your application (e.g., command-line arguments or API endpoints).
e.	Challenges Faced: A brief discussion of any technical challenges you encountered and how you solved them.
3.	Demonstration: A short video (screencast) demonstrating your application working with a sample YouTube link.

Evaluation Criteria
Your submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
•	Functionality: Does the application work as described? Does it successfully download, transcribe, and summarize a YouTube video?
•	Model Selection and Justification: The quality of your model choices and the clarity of your reasoning.
•	Code Quality: Is the code clean, well-structured, commented, and easy to understand?
•	System Design: How well are the different components (downloader, transcriber, summarizer) integrated?
•	Documentation: The clarity and completeness of your README.md file.
•	Robustness: How well does the application handle potential errors (e.g., invalid URLs, long videos)?

Bonus Points (Optional)
These are not required but will allow you to showcase additional skills:
•	Diarization: Implement speaker diarization to identify different speakers in the transcript and summary.
•	Web Interface: Build a clean and user-friendly web interface instead of a CLI.
•	Chunking for Long Videos: Implement a strategy to handle very long videos that might not fit into a model's context window or memory.
•	Containerization: Provide a Dockerfile to make your application easy to set up and run.
•	Performance Optimization: Analyze and discuss the performance of your chosen models and any steps taken to optimize inference time.
